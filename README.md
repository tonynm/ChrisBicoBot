# ChrisBicoBot
Discord Bot Programmed in Python
This bot was modelled after one of my closest friends. The bot has his catchphrases and other things that are modelled after him.
Because this bot was modelled after my friend, I had to remove some text to respect his privacy.

Where it says "Insert Emoji ID", you will have to insert the name of your emoji and the ID given to that emoji.

Where it says "@Insert User ID", you will have to insert the name of the person you are trying to mention in your Discord server.
Information on how to find the User ID can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/50rnhe/how_do_i_get_my_bot_to_mention_someone/

Where it says "Insert photo file ID", I removed the name of the file due to privacy.
You can replace this with the name of any photo you plan to use. 
An example of how you would format the name of the photo is: ChrisBicoPhoto.png.
It would be whatever you named the photo and then the file extension of the photo.

When trying to run this bot on your server, make sure to store the file in your User file.
For example, I stored mine in C:\Users\Tony.
The same goes for the photos you want to use. 

You can run the bot using the command prompt by typing: py -3 ChrisBicoBot.py         
Make sure you are using Python 3!
